  // 2. Write a loop to iterate through each character in the
  //    text and insert to (or update) the map to track that
  //    character's frequency. We suggest using my_map.count
  //    to check if a character is not yet in the map, see
  //    the README for an example.
  // Hint: you can use a range based for loop to iterate over
  // characters in a string: for (char c : text) {...}
  // ==========================================================

  // the condition in the parentheses is true. We use `while (true)`
